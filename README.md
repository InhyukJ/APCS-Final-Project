First Semester APCS Final Project - Tamagotchi Emulator

-Brief description of your project
  This project is an GUI-based tamagotchi emulator. It will attempt to recreate the functionalities of the actual tamagotchi game.
  
-List of Working features / Things I should test
  The Main UI: With the three buttons below, the user can navigate through the screen to their different functions.
    Eating, Showering, Minigames, Sleeping, Healing, Lights, Stats, Toilet will all have icons that depict them. Each selection will have their uniqe animation.
  Buttons: The three buttons allow the user to toggle through the UI.
    The first button will toggle through the 8 icons at the top and bottom, each depicting different features.
    The Second button allows the user through the options if they exist based on which of the eight icons the user chose. 
    The third button allows the user to confirm the choice the user has made.
  
-List of unresolved bugs
  Bug #1 - Accessing stats will mess with the stat fields
  Bug #2 - The arrow for the Game options is not optimized (as in, it doesn't look right visually)

-Directions on how to use your program
  Toggle through different actions with button 1 (blue one)
  In order to get out of Stats, toggle through with button 1 (blue one) to another action and perform that instead.
  Move the arrow with button 2 (seagreen).
  In order to select anything, like a blackened icon or meals vs snacks, use button 3 (purple one).
  In mini-game mode, click button 3 to get to next "screen" and play the game.
  Don't spam the buttons!!!
  WAIT FOR ANIMATION SEQUENCES TO FINISH BEFORE MOVING ON WITH THE BUTTONS PLEASE.
